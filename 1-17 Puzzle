There will be two arrays, one that represents magazine and that represents ransomNote. Each index in the array will be identified by a character. 
Index 0 aill be represent by character A and Index 1 will be represented by character B. 
We iterate over both strings and capture the character count in all the arrays.
We will then compare character count from both arrays index by index and validate
If we have enough characters available in magazine to construct ransomNote. If there
are not enough characters, it will display false. If there are, it will display true.
